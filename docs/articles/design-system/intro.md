# Eva Design System

Starting with version 4.0 Nebular becomes an Angular implementation of [Eva Design System](eva.design).
This means that components visual style and behavior are based on Design System rules and agreements.  

## Principles

Eva is a customizable Design System based on Atomic Design Principles. All components are built based on basic elements with shared styles, connected with a single Visual Language.
Most importantly, Eva is built to be customizable, meaning architectural support of multiple themes across all components and supporting platforms.  

## Implementations

Eva Design System is implemented for two platforms:

- Web - Nebular
- Mobile - [React Kitten](https://github.com/akveo/react-native-ui-kitten/)

Both implementations have single source of truth for styles, and unified theming system.

## Enterprise ready

Being a part of Eva ecosystem, Nebular is a great choice for Enterprise grade products, sharing ideas, process and implementation among multiple platforms.
